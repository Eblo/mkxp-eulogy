Here lives Google's ANGLE, which is pretty necessary right now.

On top of Apple deprecating OpenGL, MKXP has crashing issues from
the OpenGL -> Metal translation implemented in Apple Silicon macs.

Currently, the build of ANGLE here is the one provided with
Google Chrome/Chromium. Soon as ANGLE's gclient doesn't fail
on Apple Silicon macs, I'll build it myself.
